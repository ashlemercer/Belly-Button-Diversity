# Belly Button Diversity

In this Challenge, we used Plotly, D3.js, and Javascript to turn data from bacteria cultures of belly buttons, and created a pull-down menu that references the Test Subjects ID #'s to produce a bar chart, a bubble chart, and a gauge chart that shows each subjects information.

## Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart (35 points)
In Deliverable 1, we created a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species from the drop-down menu we created earlier.

We can see in the picture below the stats for Test Subject #974 in the Demographic Info box, and the corresponding Top 10 Bacteria Cultures found in their belly button in the bar chart to the right.

## Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart (30 points)
In Deliverable 2, we created a Bubble Chart to display the following when an individualâ€™s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage:
- The otu_ids as the x-axis values.
- The sample_values as the y-axis values.
- The sample_values as the marker size.
- The otu_ids as the marker colors.
- The otu_labels as the hover-text values.

And here we see the final product of the Bubble Chart, with the ability to hover over the bubbles to preview the data of each mark.

## Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart (20 points)

In Deliverable 3, we created a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and show the value on a scale of 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when a test subjects ID is selected from the dropdown menu

## Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard (20 points)
For the final deliverable, I created a dashboard with the 3 required customizations, including an added background image, customized font colors, customized font, and added information to the charts.
